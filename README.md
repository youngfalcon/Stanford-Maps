# Stanford-Maps
A Stanford-specific version of  the initial design of Google Maps.
CSS and JavaScript is embedded into the HTML file.

The user can move around the map either by dragging by mouse or using the arrow buttons.

+/- buttons can be used to zoom in/out while the point in the center of the view area stays fixed.

Double clicking a spot will move it to the center of the map.

The map frame resizs as the window is resized while the point in the center of the view area stays fixed.
